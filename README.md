# In this project we try to collect private keys that have been forgotten on Github when developers commit their password. In order to do so, we used TruffleHog (https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog).
This module will go through the entire history of changes in each industry and will check any differences from each change and will check the secrets. This is both from "regex" and from entropy. For entropy checks, truffleHog will evaluate shannon entropy for both the base64 char and hexodecimal char for each blot with text longer than 20 characters consisting of these character sets at each change. If a large entropy contribution of more than 20 characters is detected anywhere, it will be printed on the screen.
